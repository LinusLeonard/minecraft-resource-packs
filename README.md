# Minecraft Resource Packs (Java Edition)

Tested on version 1.20.2.

## Continuity on glass only

If you're trying to replace Optifabric and are using the [Continuity](https://modrinth.com/mod/continuity) mod to get connected glass textures, but you **don't want connected bookshelves and sandstone**? Then use this resource pack instead of the default resource pack that Continuity supplies.
